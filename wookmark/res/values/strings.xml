    <string name="about_view_licenses_detail_lazy_list">LazyList - This library from Fedor Vlasov is used to enable lazy 
        downloading of images off the UI thread. It provides automatic caching of images to the SD card for fast loading 
        later, as well as image scaling to preserve space. I\'ve made a few modifications to make scaling optional and provide
        some notification when an image has finished loading. This library is licensed under the MIT license. Links to the
